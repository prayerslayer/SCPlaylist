This is a jQuery Plugin that turns all custom SC-Players on your page into a playlist. That means the next track starts automatically when one finished, regardless of where they are in the DOM.

DEPENDENCIES
-------
	*	jQuery
	*	A CSS, sc-player.js and soundcloud.player.api.js from here: http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/custom-player
	*	This plugin

USAGE
-------
	Add your tracks the way it's described in the SoundCloud Documentation. Like this:
		<a class="track" href="url-to-the-track">Track-Name</a>
	Note the track class, it's important that every track has the same. "track" is default, you can specify another (read on).

	It's easy from here. Just call 
		$(div-with-your-tracks).SCPlaylist();
	and every link will be a custom SC-Player. When one finishes, the next starts automatically. If your tracks share another class than "track", call it like this:
		$(div-with-your-tracks).SCPlaylist({"tracks": "your-track-class"});

	You're invited to have a look at the example too.
